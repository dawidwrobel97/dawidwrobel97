### Hello ðŸ‘‹ 

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a junior Flutter developer who likes to build cool and practical mobile apps related to my hobbies.

ðŸš€ Right now, I'm honing my skills in Flutter and Dart and checking out the latest trends in mobile app development, as well as focusing on writing clean code that's easy to understand (hopefully I'm doing a good job ðŸ˜…).

ðŸ’¡ I only have one bigger project so far, but I'm working on making more, with the focus on making my hobbies more fun! ðŸ¦¾
